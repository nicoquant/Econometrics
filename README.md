One can find code (built from scratch) to fit the data to a model from the ARMA familly. 3 methods have been implemented to fit the data with an AR(p) (Yule Walker, Least Square and Conditional Maximum Likelihood), 1 method have been implemented to fit the data with the MA(q) and 1 method have been implemented to fit the data with the ARMA(p,q). Results are very close from those found using the statsmodels package.
